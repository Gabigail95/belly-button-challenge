# # Project Goal
This focus of this project is on developing an interactive dashboard that analyzes a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset--which documents microbes in human navels.
The data indicates that just a few microbial species (referred to as operational taxonomic units (OTUs)) were found in over 70% of individuals, while the others were comparatively uncommon.

The dashboards consist of an interactive Bar Graph and Bubble Chart that will allow one to view the outputs per individual.
